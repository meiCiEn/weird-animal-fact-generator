# 🐾 Weird Animal Fact Generator

## Description
This is a JavaScript programme that generates a random "animal oddity" fact each time it runs. It combines a random animal, the region it’s found in, and a strange or surprising trait.

Each message looks something like this:
> The axolotl, found in Mexico, can regrow its brain and heart!

## How It Works
- The data is stored as an array of objects.
- Each object includes three properties: `animal`, `location`, and `trait`.
- The program randomly selects one object from the array.
- It then formats and displays a message based on the selected object.

## Future Ideas
- Add more animals and facts
- Create a web interface with a "Generate New Fact" button
- Style the output using CSS
- Allow users to copy or share the fact
